## Discription
In this application you can find your best friend! Thats right! All you have to do is take a simple 10 question survey. After you complete the survey then your best friend will appear!
How does it work? Well, it will take your survey's answer and stores them in the data base and brings back the most compatiable match in the data base for you. On a side note, I had a lot of fun testing this application out
with my family and i hope you do too!

Enjoy and Have Fun!
